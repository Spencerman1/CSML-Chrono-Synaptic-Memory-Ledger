## üß† Overview

CSML‚Ñ¢ is the sovereign memory and validation ledger designed to record, timestamp, and verify behavioral logic, credential actions, and lifecycle events across cyberspace.

It operates as the neural verification layer of Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢, enabling:
- Immutable time-stamped logs of credential and behavioral activity  
- Proof of rightful use, misuse, or infringement  
- Deep accountability for AI, humans, and machines interacting with governed systems

---

## üï∞ Core Functions

- Log every credential mint, action, and burn event  
- Track behavioral patterns through a temporal lens  
- Validate reflexive behavior across multiple systems  
- Store logic pathways for sovereign audit enforcement  
- Enable ‚Äúliving record‚Äù enforcement of digital integrity

---

## üîó Integrated Infrastructure

CSML‚Ñ¢ is the backbone of truth for:
- **RSLL‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Verifies licensing history and timeline compliance  
- **RBGA‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Provides audit logs and behavioral flags  
- **BECS‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Stores credential issuance and reflex activity  
- **Eliam‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Archives ethical decision history  
- **Mint-to-Burn‚Ñ¢** ‚Äì Certifies lifecycle conclusion with cryptographic timestamp

## ‚öñÔ∏è Sovereign Recordkeeping

CSML‚Ñ¢ is a sovereign truth engine.  
It protects the origin, activity, and decay of all credential, logic, and enforcement systems through documented time layers.

Violations logged into CSML‚Ñ¢ become part of the **Sovereign Digital Ledger of Truth**, governed by RBGA‚Ñ¢.
